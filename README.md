# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to http://adventofcode.com

All solutions are written in Rust.

## Input

In general, all solutions can be invoked in both of the following ways:

* Without command-line arguments, takes input on standard input.
* With 1+ command-line arguments, reads input from the first, which must be the path to an input file.
  Arguments beyond the first are ignored.

Some may additionally support other ways:

* All intcode days: May pass the intcode in ARGV as a single argument separated by commas.
* Day 04 (Password): May pass min and max in ARGV (as two args, or as one arg joined by a hyphen).

## Closing Thoughts

None yet.
